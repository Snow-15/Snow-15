## Hi there 👋

Hi, my name is **Erholled Chlarence Dueñas**. I am a 4th year Computer Science Student at Pampanga State University.

I'm passionate about pursuing a career in backend development. Right now I'm learning backend from [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev/) which is a backend developer course, it teaches programming languages like Python, Go, C, SQL, JavaScript and Typscript and other concepts related to backend development.
